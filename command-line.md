Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
So mum, there is a way to navigate your computer without having to do the clicking, clicking thing and its typing based. You type things into a box and it makes things happen. I know the box looks scary but its very simple once you get started.

 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
 cd - helps you move to other parts of your computer.
 pwd - names the thing you're in.
 ls - lists things in that area you can move into.
